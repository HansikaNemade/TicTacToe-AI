TicTacToe-AI

Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax is a recursive algorithm where the computer (our code) maximizes its chance of winning by simulating all possible moves, alternating between maximizing and minimizing players, until a terminal state (win, lose, or draw) is reached, then choosing the move that leads to the best outcome.
